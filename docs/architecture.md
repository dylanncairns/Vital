System Overview
    Vital is an exposure and symptom logging system,  operating with a server-side analytics layer and a shared, versioned knowledge database. The system exists to provide insight into patterns in users's exposures and symptoms that established research may contextualize as worthy of further investigation.
    Vital does not make medical, safety, or causal claims.
    Our users log events locally on their device, which syncs to a backend for persistence and analysis. Our analytics then measure user events against a shared knowledge and evidence database, and return trends of overlap between exposures to substances which have been investigated as potential sources for the symptoms that the user's timeline correlates with and explanations with provenance that offer insights.
